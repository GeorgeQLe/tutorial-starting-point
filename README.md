# G Can Build - Walkthrough Starter Template

Welcome to the G Can Build Walkthrough starter template! This repository serves as the foundation for the YouTube walkthrough series where we explore building and deploying modern web applications. Link to the YT Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeLe

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, production-ready tech stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) with React 19
- **API Layer**: [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for end-to-end typesafe APIs
- **Database**: NeonDB (Serverless Postgres) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) with tRPC integration
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**:
  - Radix UI primitives
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui component library
  - Various UI utilities (date-fns, recharts, etc.)

## 🛠️ Getting Started
